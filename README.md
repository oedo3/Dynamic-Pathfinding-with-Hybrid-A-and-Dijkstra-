# Dynamic-Pathfinding-with-Hybrid-A-and-Dijkstra-
This Python project combines A* and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms for adaptive pathfinding in dynamic graphs, using Manhattan distance for A*. It dynamically switches between algorithms based on real-time graph updates, ideal for map applications, game development, and real-time systems.
